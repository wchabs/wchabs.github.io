            <h3>Chalk</h3>
            <p>Chalk and chalk bag. Something you can rent if you forget yours at home. It also depends on your sweat glands, I can only do one climb without it. There's also a liquid version as well that's quick drying. I prefer the chalk sock to loose chalk but it's whatever you're comfortable with for your climbs.</p>

            <h3>Climbing shoes</h3>
            <p>This is defintely personal preference but they should be snug. Really snug. For beginners it could just be snug but as you progress you'll see that a little less room for your feet to move around will really help when on the walls. In the beginning a flat arch should be ok. Again as you progress you'll see the difference when wearing shoes with more of an arch. If you feel your foot moving when you preform heel hooks then there is probbaly too much room and should go for a smaller shoe size.</p>

            <h3>Socks?</h3>
            <p>Socks are controversial. Whenever I get a new pair of shoes I wear slim no show socks. They're not the greatest but they do the trick. I will say that many frown upon wearing socks with climbing shoes. I get it - need to feel the shoe against the rock. But I also want my shoes to last without getting funky. Once my shoes are all worn down do I go sans socks. My preference and I'm sure you'll have yours.</p>

            <h3>Tape</h3>
            <p>Your fingers could get worn and strained from time to time. Best remedy is to rest before climbing again. But if you can't enough and want to get on as soon as possible then taping up your fingers and wrists for support is next best option. Careful though. Don't strain yourself so much that the doctor will eventually say you need to put a pause on climbing for a few months. It's not a good feeling.</p>

            <h3>Harness</h3>
            <p>You'll need a harness if you plan on climbing top rope or lead. Several to choose fom so find one that's comfortable for you. It's used for both climbing and belaying and you'll go through several training sessions to make sure uour safety game is not lacking.</p>

            <h3>Crash pad</h3>
            <p>Similar feel to the mats around the bouldering area wihtin the climbing gym. You will fall off the wall. That's a given. In addition to having a spot the crash pad will help by decreasing the impact of the fall.</p>

            <h3>Rope</h3>
            <p>Once you start lead climbing and doing so on actual rock then you will need rope. This may or may not be available for rental at your local climbing gym. There are different sizes and widths so make sure you get he right one as it is among the more expensive items of your gear.</p>

            <h3>Helmet</h3>
            <p>Similar to crash pad when it comes to saefty. The question isn't whether you will fall off the wall/rock or not but rather of when you will fall off.</p>
