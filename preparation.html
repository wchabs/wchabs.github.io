        <h3>Preparation and training</h3>
        <p>Climbing regularly is training enough. Your body awareness will start to increase over time. The below are just some supplemental training that you could incorporate to progress further and perhaps a little faster.</p>
    </div>
        
    <div class="traininghero">
        <h3>Core and body awareness</h3>
        <ul class="trainlist">
            <li>Planks - both regular and side planks. Place yourself in the push-up position with elbows on the floor holding you up. Flex your abs in a way that lifts your belly button area upward. Start with a few sets of 15 seconds and build your way up to a minute.</li>
            <li>Dead hangs - place your hands on a pull-up bar or similar surface with your palms facing away from you. You hang on holding your weight for as long as you can. A few sets to start and increase time as you progress.</li>
            <li>Squats and lunges - no weights or bar needed. Follow porper form and do them slowly. As you progress attempt single leg squats. Feet should about shoulder width apart with toes poiting straight ahead with a slight outward angle being acceptable. As you squat down make sure to keep your back straight, tailbone area outward, knees on our outside of toes, and ankles should not bend inward.</li>
            <li>Stretch - increase your flexability and mobility.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>More "advanced" training</h3>
        <ul class="trainlist">
            <li>Weighted exercises - add weights to rows, squats, and bench. Overall workout to keep in balance.</li>
            <li>Pull-ups - once dead-hangs are easy for you then start pull-ups. Depending on your starting strength you can start with a jump to help with the initial pull-up and then lower yourself back down slowly. Or you cn go straight into one armed pull-ups. All up to you.</li>
            <li>Campus board - you'll see this in the training area of the climbing gym. It's a board that may have a slight angle and rows of bars with varying depth. Train finger and grip strength by climbing by using just your arms.</li>
            <li>Palm grips or palm balls - varying degrees of resistance. This will execise the fingers and forearms increasing your grip strength.</li>
            <li>Swimming - Iknow what you're thinking, "what does swimming have to do with climbing?!" Check out Place to climb section for a brief overview into DWS (Deep Water Solo). But if that's not a goal of yours then do it for the aerobic conditioning.</li>
