    <h3 class="hgh">Japans geographical overview</h3>
    <p class="hjuy">Japan, lying off the eastern coast of the Asian continent, consists of four main islands - Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu - as well as thousands of adjacent smaller islands.  The archipelago runs in an arc from north to south, stretching 3,800 km.    Its total land area is 377,818 sq km, which is about 4% of that of the United States and slightly more than one and a half times as large as that of Britain.  Japan occupies about 0.3% of the earth's total land area.

      Mountains claim 71% of Japan's land area, with plains and basins accounting for the remaining 29%. A chain of mountains extends along the middle of the long, narrow archipelago, dividing it into two sides, one facing the Pacific and the other the Sea of Japan. In general, the rivers are short and swift-flowing.

      The archipelago is washed by the warm Japan and Tsushima currents and the cold Kurile current.  Japan abounds in volcanoes, including about one tenth of the world's active ones.  Mount Fuji, the country's highest peak, is a dormant volcano.

      The general climate, except for part of Hokkaido in the north and some of the southernmost islands, is temperate with seasonal winds.  Rainfall is abundant, ranging from 1,000 - 3,000 millimeters annually.  Japan has well-defined changes of season: In the summer southeasterly winds blow across the archipelago from the Pacific, while in the winter northwesterly winds sweep across the archipelago from the Asian continent.</p>
