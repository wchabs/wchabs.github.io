    <h2>Art</h2>
      <p>Scattered across the tiny fishing island of Naoshima is a contemporary art haul that would turn the Tate Modern green with envy. Following investment from a wealthy Japanese publishing magnate, the island’s status as part of a major art hub was confirmed in 2010 with the launch of Setouchi Triennale, a three yearly festival of art that takes place across 12 islands in order to benefit the elderly fishing communities on each.</p>

    <h2> Festivals</h2>
      <p>There are countless local festivals (matsuri) in Japan because almost every shrine celebrates one of its own. Most festivals are held annually and celebrate the shrine's deity or a seasonal or historical event. Some festival are held over several days.

        An important element of Japanese festivals are processions, in which the local shrine's kami (Shinto deity) is carried through the town in mikoshi (palanquins). It is the only time of the year when the kami leaves the shrine to be carried around town.Many festivals also feature decorated floats (dashi), which are pulled through the town, accompanied by drum and flute music by the people sitting on the floats. Every festival has its own characteristics. While some festivals are calm and meditative, many are energetic and noisy.</p>
    <h2> The Cities</h2>
      <p>When it comes to vibrant, bustling cities, Japan can deliver. The country holds many population hubs to explore and uncover.
